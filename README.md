# Hundred Fish Speedrun Tool

## Why?

One day while doing Wii Play 100 Fish attempts, I wanted to simplify the process of figuring out how much fish I need because I easily forgot the number of fish I caught in one game which caused 2 resets, which promptly grew me tired and I made this program to combat myself.

## Building

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and then run these commands:

```shell
git clone -b rust https://github.com/65hz/100FishSpeedrunTool.git hfst
cd hfst
cargo install --path .
```

This will automatically be added to your PATH; you can simply just run `hfst` on your terminal and you are done!
