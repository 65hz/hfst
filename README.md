# Hundred Fish Speedrun Tool

## Why?

One day while doing Wii Play 100 Fish attempts, I wanted to simplify the process of figuring out how much fish I need because I easily forgot the number of fish I caught in one game which caused 2 resets, which promptly grew me tired and I made this program to combat myself.

## Building

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and then build the code with

```shell
cargo build --release
```

and then run it with

```shell
./target/release/hfst.exe
```
